# Caution: experimental

This is an experiment in porting my apm2-sensor system which ran on the old
atmega2560 apm2 hardware.  The target system will be a teensy 3.2 connected
to an mpu9250 breakout board.  Hopefully there will be an onboard static 
pressure sensor, sbus input support, pwm servo out support, and maybe gps
(ublox 8+) support.

The goal is for a hobby grade system that anyone could put together with 
meager soldering skills (i.e. you can solder 0.1" headers onto a board.)
